### Hi there! üëã

I am a Postdoctoral Scholar at the University of California, Merced in theoretical chemistry. My research focuses on molecular dynamics, including classical, mixed QM/MM, and nonadiabatic simulations with applications to polaritons, UV-Vis spectroscopy, and machine learning. My work is also tailored towards scientific software development for high performance computing environments, interfacing quantum chemistry programs with molecular mechanics packages and optimizing spectroscopy calculations.

I also have a background in force field development for MD simulations of nucleic acids and other large biomolecules, as well as experience working with a variety of experimental groups in mass spectrometry, polymer chemistry, and various flavors of spectroscopy. I also have a background in computer science, software development, and teaching.

### Favorite Coding Projects
Some of the various projects that I have built or actively contribute to may help you with your research goals:
* [AI-LSC-IVR](https://github.com/AnanthGroup/AI-LSC-IVR) A nonadibatic, semiclassics simulation program that interfaces with TeraChem and GAMESS electronic structure programs.
* [MolSpecPy](https://github.com/tjz21/Spectroscopy_python_code) A Python package for simulating various optical spectroscopies from quantum chemisty data.  
* [AmberFD](https://github.com/ChristopherAMyers/AmberFD) library for extending OpenMM with a fluctuating density model (In review, [ChemRxiv](https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2023-1rvh3)). Also check out it's [documentation](https://christopheramyers.github.io/AmberFD_Documentation/html/index.html)!
