### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I am a Postdoctoral Scholar at the University of California, Merced in theoretical chemistry, focusing on the development of molecular dynamics techniques and density functional theory models for the prediction of condense phase spectroscopy. For my Ph.D., my research focused on the development of molecular dynamics algorithms informed from density functional theory to study various biomolecules. My work is highly coding based and overlaps nicely with data science and machine learning. I also have a background in computer science, software development, and teaching.

### Favorite Coding Projects
Some of my favorite projects include:
* [AmberFD](https://github.com/ChristopherAMyers/AmberFD) library for extending OpenMM with a fluctuating density model (In review, [ChemRxiv](https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2023-1rvh3)). Also check out it's [documentation](https://christopheramyers.github.io/AmberFD_Documentation/html/index.html)!
* [CoSIMS](https://github.com/ChristopherAMyers/CoSIMS): A Collision Simulator for Ion Mobility Spectrometry. Published in [*J. Phys. Chem. B* 2019.](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.9b01018)
* A Python based [QM/MM interface](https://github.com/ChristopherAMyers/QM_MM_Simulations) that links OpenMM and Q-Chem

### Skills and Technical Abilities
#### Computer Languages and Systems
* Advanced fluency in C++ and Python.
* Intermediate fluency in C, C#, Java, Matlab, Bash, Mathematica, LaTeX.
* Experienced with the procedures for designing, optimizing, and documenting new software.
* Unix operating systems, Git and GitHub versioning software.
* OpenMP parallelization

#### Algorithms
Experience with numerical optimization techniques, numerical integration, and linear algebra.
Strong background in density functional theory and molecular mechanics algorithms.
Familiar with Bayesian, maximum entropy and machine learning algorithms.
