### Hi there! 👋

🔭 I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University at Albany studying computational chemistry and physics, and I am currently looking for postdoctoral positions in scientific coding or electronic structure theory. My research focuses on the development of molecular dynamics algorithms informed from density functional theory to study various biomolecules. My research is highly coding based and overlaps nicely with data science and machine learning.
